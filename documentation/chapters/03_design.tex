\section{Component diagram}

The system will be organized in a classical client-server configuration, and the latter will expose RESTful APIs to the clients, and a web application for both OPs and PRs. Every service will be in its own servlet. The component diagram is shown in Figure \ref{fig:component}.

\section{Logical description of data}

The data will be stored into a relational database, which will be designed according to the Logical schema in Figure \ref{fig:er}.

\section{Deployment}

All the webapp will be entirely deployed on the free hosting service \href{www.altervista.org}{Altervista}, which provides a MySQL database and a php server, so all the problems of deployment, reliability, scalability, and security are handled by the service provider.

\section{UX design}

The webapp will be designed with a simple and intuitive interface, with a clean and modern look.

The UX is explained at an high level in the flow diagrams in Figures \ref{fig:flow_book_submission} and \ref{fig:flow_op}.

\section{User interface}

Still WIP. Screenshots will be added in a future release of the document.
